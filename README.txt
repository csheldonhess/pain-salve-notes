Since pain can often be accompanied by emotional distress, chamomile brings welcome relief on many levels."

Burns

“Oil of Peppermint is rubefacient and anodyne. It is used alone or in combination with other oils for the relief of neuralgia and toothache, in both of which it is often very efficient. …Still it is used largely to relieve local pain, especially that of burns and scalds.”  - Felter’s Materia Medica, 1922

"*(German) Chamomile* can be used externally as a poultice, fomentation, bath, or liniment to help calm inflammatory responses. Think of it for rashes, burns, or even bleeding gums and oral mucositis.7 8"

"One interesting study compared the topical use of *(German) chamomile* compresses with hydrocortisone cream for relieving itching and discomfort associated with skin lesions in people who have stomas (a surgically created opening in the abdomen that allows stool or urine to exit the body). Participants were either given a 1 percent hydrocortisone cream or chamomile compresses twice a day. Those using the compresses had a significantly faster healing time as well as a considerable decrease in pain and itching compared with those using the steroid cream. The researchers also pointed out that using chamomile instead of the steroid cream prevents serious side effects associated with topical steroid use, such as thinning of the skin.9"
