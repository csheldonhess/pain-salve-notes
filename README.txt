Herbs for topical use in pain salves
====================================

First, a couple of notes: 
- I've been very careful, here, to only indicate herbs that will work if applied topically, and I tried very hard to limit to herbs that make sense in salve form. This has been made somewhat difficult, because _so many materias medica_ are vague on internal versus external, salve versus liniment, tea versus infusion versus syrup versus tincture. "This herb is good for that" is great, but _how_ is this herb great for that? 
- They're my notes. I can get ranty if I want to.
- Cayenne shows up a lot. If you're using cayenne-containing salve, you're going to need to wear gloves or wash your hands **super** well (and then still be careful not to touch your eyes). Honestly, I don't use my own cayenne-ginger-peppermint salve nearly as often as I should, for exactly this reason.



Joint pain
----------
"Numerous studies have shown **ginger** to be effective and safe at relieving arthritic pain both through topical application and taking it internally." -HerbMentor, Ginger

"Capsaicin, a major constituent of **cayenne peppers**, blocks substance P which relays pain sensations in your body. Cayenne is used topically to relieve many different types of pain, from diabetic neuropathy1, shingles2, migraine headaches, back aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains." -HerbMentor, Cayenne

"(Rosemary) has long been used for inflammatory pain such as arthritis. Herbalists recommend both taking it internally and using it externally over the affected areas." -HerbMentor, Rosemary


Muscle pain
-----------
"**Ginger** has also been shown to relieve muscle pain after workouts." -HerbMentor, Ginger

“The active constituent in **peppermint** is menthol and is responsible for the cooling effect peppermint has. Menthol also inhibits the nerves that react to painful stimuli, giving relief to muscle spasms, coughs, intestinal cramping and more.” - Kristine Brown, Herbal Roots Zine: Peppermint (via HerbMentor)

"As an Antispasmodic - Peppermint can ease tonic muscles. It can be used for menstrual cramps or a sore back."
"Infusing peppermint into oil leaves you with an oil that is great for sore muscles, pain, and cramping that can be used externally." -HerbMentor, Peppermint

"Capsaicin, a major constituent of **cayenne peppers,** blocks substance P which relays pain sensations in your body. Cayenne is used topically to relieve many different types of pain, from diabetic neuropathy1, shingles2, migraine headaches, back aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains." -HerbMentor, Cayenne

"For Muscle Tension, Cramps and Pain - **(German) Chamomile** is also relaxing to the musculature. I reach for it whenever there is muscle tension related to stress or simply muscle tension leading to pain. I’ve seen it relieve severe menstrual cramps, as well as headaches that are accompanied by excess tension in the upper back and neck. Since pain can often be accompanied by emotional distress, chamomile brings welcome relief on many levels." -HerbMentor, Chamomile

"For relieving muscle tension and pain chamomile ... can also be used externally on the affected area as an infused oil, diluted essential oil, or liniment." -HerbMentor, Chamomile



Bruises
-------
"A bruise or contusion is an example of stagnant blood that we can easily see. **Ginger** can be applied topically to relieve blood stagnation." -HerbMentor, Ginger

(**Maybe peppermint** - rubefacient, anodyne -HerbMentor, Peppermint)

(**Maybe cayenne** - "Capsaicin, a major constituent of cayenne peppers, blocks substance P which relays pain sensations in your body. Cayenne is used topically to relieve many different types of pain, from diabetic neuropathy1, shingles2, migraine headaches, back aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains." -HerbMentor, Cayenne)



Neuropathy (nerve pain)
-----------------------
**(Maybe)** "It can be applied externally to relieve pain as well. A friend of mine with neuropathy in his feet due to diabetes swears that **peppermint essential oil** is the only thing that relieves his pain." -HerbMentor, Peppermint

"Capsaicin, a major constituent of **cayenne peppers,** blocks substance P which relays pain sensations in your body. Cayenne is used topically to relieve many different types of pain, from diabetic neuropathy1, shingles2, migraine headaches, back aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains." -HerbMentor, Cayenne

"Another study looked at topical **(German) chamomile** for carpal tunnel syndrome pain. In this pilot study the researchers concluded that “Chamomile oil improved symptomatic and functional status of patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome.”5" -HerbMentor, Cayenne



Menstrual pain
--------------
**Ginger** (study, PubMed, look up again)

"Infusing **peppermint** into oil leaves you with an oil that is great for sore muscles, pain, and cramping that can be used externally."
"As an Antispasmodic - Peppermint can ease tonic muscles. It can be used for menstrual cramps or a sore back." -HerbMentor, Peppermint

"Capsaicin, a major constituent of **cayenne peppers,** blocks substance P which relays pain sensations in your body. Cayenne is used topically to relieve many different types of pain, from diabetic neuropathy1, shingles2, migraine headaches, back aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains." -HerbMentor, Cayenne

I’ve seen it relieve severe menstrual cramps, as well as headaches that are accompanied by excess tension in the upper back and neck. Since pain can often be accompanied by emotional distress, chamomile brings welcome relief on many levels." -HerbMentor, Chamomile



Headaches
---------
"**Peppermint** works wonderfully to soothe pain. It is commonly used for headaches." -HerbMentor, Peppermint

(Maybe? On temples?) "Capsaicin, a major constituent of **cayenne peppers,** blocks substance P which relays pain sensations in your body. Cayenne is used topically to relieve many different types of pain, from diabetic neuropathy1, shingles2, migraine headaches, back aches, arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains." -HerbMentor, Cayenne



Burns
-----
"**Peppermint** can also relieve the itching and inflammation of sunburns, poison oak/ivy and hives. You can use the tea as a wash or add a strong brew to bath water." -HerbMentor, Peppermint

“Oil of Peppermint is rubefacient and anodyne. It is used alone or in combination with other oils for the relief of neuralgia and toothache, in both of which it is often very efficient. …Still it is used largely to relieve local pain, especially that of burns and scalds.”  - Felter’s Materia Medica, 1922 (via HerbMentor)

"**(German) Chamomile** can be used externally as a poultice, fomentation, bath, or liniment to help calm inflammatory responses. Think of it for rashes, burns, or even bleeding gums and oral mucositis.7 8" -HerbMentor, Chamomile




Messed up tendons and ligaments (plantar fasciitis, carpal tunnel)
------------------------------------------------------------------
"Another study looked at topical **(German) chamomile** for carpal tunnel syndrome pain. In this pilot study the researchers concluded that “Chamomile oil improved symptomatic and functional status of patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome.”5" -HerbMentor, Chamomile



Bug bites
---------
"**Peppermint** can also relieve the itching and inflammation of sunburns, poison oak/ivy and hives. You can use the tea as a wash or add a strong brew to bath water." -HerbMentor, Peppermint

**(Maybe) "(German) Chamomile** can be used externally as a poultice, fomentation, bath, or liniment to help calm inflammatory responses. Think of it for rashes, burns, or even bleeding gums and oral mucositis.7 8" -HerbMentor, Chamomile



Cuts and scrapes
----------------
"**Cayenne**’s anti-microbial properties can also prevent infections." -HerbMentor, Cayenne 
Also styptic. -Wild Cherries Herbal Studies Program

"One interesting study compared the topical use of **(German) chamomile** compresses with hydrocortisone cream for relieving itching and discomfort associated with skin lesions in people who have stomas (a surgically created opening in the abdomen that allows stool or urine to exit the body). Participants were either given a 1 percent hydrocortisone cream or chamomile compresses twice a day. Those using the compresses had a significantly faster healing time as well as a considerable decrease in pain and itching compared with those using the steroid cream. The researchers also pointed out that using chamomile instead of the steroid cream prevents serious side effects associated with topical steroid use, such as thinning of the skin.9" -HerbMentor, Chamomile
